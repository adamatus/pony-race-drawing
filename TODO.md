Before Next Release
===================
- Make things visually appealing
- Make sure colorpicker has assigned a useable value in case user does not
  change anything in color picker (currently defaulting to black even though
  picker seems to show white)

Short-Term Improvements
=======================
- Get a proper open-source color picker... menucool.com colorpicker works as
  desired, but license will not work
- Have ponies rock and follow a sinusoidal curve (like they do in the real
  carnival game)
- Add mouseover pop-ups to describe horses
- Remove a color from picker once it has been used?
- Add this into an expanded options section which is hidden by default
    - Add option to switch between rect/pony/bike
    - Add speed control/logic
    - Add ability to randomize pony order
    - Add R->L / L->R switch

Long-Term Improvements
======================
- Add a replay slider which will slide through the whole race
