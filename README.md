Carnival-style Pony Race
====

Need to pick a winner, but can't find a hat or pieces of scrap paper?  Have no
fear! Enter the classic carnival-style pony race. Give each person a pony (or
more than one) and set those ponies racing.  We don't have water guns to shoot
or balls to roll, so your fate rests in the hands on a random number generator! 

### Features

* Unlimited number of jockeys
* Each jockey can have a unique number of ponies
* Don't like ponies? Race bikes or cars instead (upcoming feature)
